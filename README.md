# ai_co_scientist
An agentic framework for an ai co-scientist. 

Based on the Octotols framework: https://github.com/octotools/octotools

The agent focuses on three main capabilities: 
  1. Deep technical reasoning + math skill
  2. Long context window (to ingest papers, specs, layouts)
  3. Ability to generate and critique code / architectures.
  
An additional feature is the ability to run consumer-grade hardware.
